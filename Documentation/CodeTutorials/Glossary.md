## DBMS
Database Management System.  Refers to a specific proprietary engine e.g. Oracle, MySql, SqlServer.  

A feature that is compatible with multiple DBMS is one which works regardless of the database engine hosting the data and may support drawing data from multiple providers/instances at once.

## UNION

Mathematical set operation which matches unique (distinct) identifiers in **any** datasets being combined (e.g. SetA UNION SetB returns any patient in **either SetA or SetB**).  

## INTERSECT

Mathematical set operation which matches unique (distinct) identifiers  **only** if they appear in **all** datasets being combined (e.g. SetA INTERSECT SetB returns patients who appear in **both SetA and SetB**).

## EXCEPT

Mathematical set operation which matches unique (distinct) identifiers  **in the first dataset** only if they **do not appear in any of the subsequent datasets** being combined (e.g. SetA EXCEPT SetB returns patients who appear in **SetA but not SetB**).
